# MiniSnip
Meet MiniSnip, the smallest and fastest way to capture your screen and extract text with OCR. Open-source and never connects to the internet. MiniSnip is feather-light, uses minimal resources, and stays completely out of your way. MiniSnip lives in your system tray. Just one hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+C) is all you need to start.
